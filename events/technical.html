								<p><i>When you launch a rocket, you’re not really flying that rocket. You’re just sort of hanging on.
 – Michael P. Anderson </i></p>
 <p>
   YANTRIK`16 brings forth a platform to make your own rocket! Larger the distance a
rocket covers, the better it is. But the challenge is not limited to maximum range but
accuracy as well. Put on your thinking caps and hatch out a new design that stands apart
from the rest and fulfills your dream of flight! This is certainly a test on the
aerodynamics of model. And most importantly, it`s just fun to make a rocket.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>ROUND 1(RANGE):</b>
In this round, the teams will be tested for the maximum horizontal distance travelled by their rocket.<br>
The rocket has to be launched such that it covers a minimum distance of 35 meters.<br>
The teams which cross 35 meters will be qualified for the second round.<br>
Scores will be awarded as per the given formula<br>
<b> Score = Total distance travelled in met</b>
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>ROUND 2(ACCURACY):</b><br>
The rocket should be launched from a distance from pre-selected target and depending upon the deviation from the bull’s eye, and one ring will arrange in front of target all participants should launch the rocket through that ring ,scores will awarded(Maximum 100 points if it hits bull’s eye).<br>
 Finally, for results, sum of the scores from both rounds will be taken into consideration.<br>

<b> In case of tie, 3rd round will be conducted. </b>
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>ROUND 3(TIME OF FLIGHT):</b><br>
The team with maximum time of flight will win tie breaker (or) winner will be decided
on launcher design
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Rules and regulations:</b><br>
• Team should consist a maximum of 3 members.<br>
• The water will be provided on the venue.<br>
• No additives should be used.<br>
• Soft drinks/Aerated water are not allowed<br>
• Chemical propellants and boosters are strictly prohibited.<br>
• Participants should bring their own equipment i.e., launcher, bottles, foot pumps(pressure pump), etc.<br>
• Two chances will be given to each team and best of two will be considered.<br>
• Pressure inside the bottle should not exceed 90 psi in both rounds.<br>
• The launcher angle is of team’s choice.<br>
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>NOTE: Any team will be disqualified:</b><br>
• If rocket explodes before the launch.<br>
• If any rocket is found dangerous for launch by the organizer and judges.<br>
• If any readymade models are used.<br>
• The organizer reserves all rights to change any of the above rules as they dream fit. Changes in rules if any, will be highlighted on the website. In case of any discrepancy, the decision of judges shall be treated as final. <br>

                <p>Navika is a competition aimed towards creating an interest among the engineering
students towards the new concept of designing a water vehicle. Design a water vehicle
(ship or boat) as per your interest by following the specification, make a model and
compete with the opponents in the given arena.<br>
Max. number of participants :3/ team</p>
<p><b>
Rules and regulations:</b><br>
1. The Arena dimensions will be given on spot.<br>
2. Participants should bring DC motor, propeller, battery, wires (any other material if
they want they can).<br>
3. Design of your vehicle should be finished before the starting of the event.<br>
4. Design should be as per specifications.<br>
5. If reason is genuine, we will try to provide material for repairs.<br>
6. No physical force is applied while racing, if any team do this type of activities that
team will be eliminated.<br></p>
<p><b>
Specifications:</b><br>
1. Dimensions of 30*15 (l*b).<br>
2.The maximum limit of battery is 12V.<br>
3. The motor speed limit is 300rpm. <br></p>
<p><b>
Round-1 (Design analysis and race for single team only):</b><br>
Design of the water boat will be checked by following specification limits. Then only the
boat will be permitted to enter the arena for race. The teams whose vehicles will
balance and move without sinking will be qualified for next round. Time will be
considered for the participants to send them to second round.</p>
<p><b>
Round-2 (race between two teams):</b><br>
All the qualified teams will be participating in the race with their opponents (i.e. is
decided by the coordinators of the event), obstacles are arranged in the arena. Best of
them will be declared by considering the progress of the team, model, some features
like aerodynamic shape, size, weight, materials used etc.</p>
<p><b>
Note: Time will be taken to consideration to declare the winner.</b></p>

                <p>Now a-days everyone like racing but on plane roads this year’s Robo race gives you an opportunity to build an all-terrain rover to test you’re off road skills. In this competition you are required to build a rover that fulfills the specifications given below and traverse an impassable terrain that would be created at the event location.  </p>
						<p>  max number of participants :3/ team </p>
						<h2> Design specifications: </h2>

						<p> 1) The device must be powered by rechargeable batteries. No other sources of energy are permitted.</p>
						<p> 2) The device must be controlled either through a transmitter/receiver radio link  or through an umbilical cord. An umbilical cord controller may not contain any batteries.</p>
						<p> 3) The transmitter/receiver radio link may be any commercially available model controller</p>
						<p> 4) All radio controllers will be impounded and shut off at the competition, except during the team’s run</p>
						<p> 5) Mechanical forces on the umbilical cord may not be used to help propel or  control the vehicle. The umbilical cord must be detachable from the vehicle using a commercial connector. The umbilical card may not be a part of the supporting structure of the device. The umbilical cord may only be used to transmit the commands from the controller. Teams will be disqualified if, at any time, the umbilical cord is used to apply mechanical force to the device. </p>
						<p> 6) Robot dimensions should not exceed 25*25 (L*B) (in cm)(with wheels). </p>
						<p> 7) The battery voltage should not exceed more than 12 volts.  </p>

						<h2> EVENT DETAILS:  </h2>
						<p> The event is a team event with at least 2 members but not more than 4 members per team. </p>
						<h2> RACING REGION:  </h2>
						<p> Racing region is the uneven terrain as the round number increases intensity of obstacles increase depending up on the number of teams. </p>
						<p> In this round the participant is given a maze to solve and he needs to find his way out of that maze and make his rover to pass through the track. Total time is considered for the bot to pass the track. </p>
						<h2> Note: The length of the track may be changed by the judges depending upon the situation at the event. The below image only for reference but not the actual one. </h2>
						<p> for example</p>
						<a> <img src="../asserts/images/track.jpg"/></a>
						<h2> Round 2</h2>
						<p> In this round the rover has to pass through a track filled with various terrains and obstacles such as water, sand, fire, grass, uneven terrain etc. </p>
					 <h2> Note: The terrain may be subjected to change depending on the situation and the decision of the judge is final.  </h2>
					 <br>
					 <h2> Round 3: </h2>
					 <p> In this round we will take the participants who have qualified in second round only. In this round a circular area or any shaped area will be provided and some components will be placed in that area. Two rovers will be placed in the area in such a way that it should be as a fight between two rovers. The winner will be the rover which drops the more components out of the given area. </p>
					<p> Note: Certain time limit will be given </p>
					<br>
					<h2> NOTE </h2>
					<p> Only the above cases will be considered </p>
					<p> The Format of the round may be changed </p>
					<p> Number of round will be finally decided at the event or the above given may be considered.</p>
					<h2> Rules and regulations: </h2>
					<p>Only team members can operate the bot.</p>
<p>Team members are not permitted to touch either machines or those of their opponents once the game begins.</p>
<p> Violation of any rules or specification leads to elimination.</p>
<p>We are not responsible for damage of bots. </p>
						<h2> Bot specifications:  </h2>

 							<p>Power supply should be less than or equal to 12 volts.</p>
							<p>Each team must have their own batteries. External power supply will not be provided.</p>
							<p>	The power supply may be placed on the robot. </p>
							<h2> Team specifications:  </h2>
							<p>Team members can belong to different educational institution or same
institute.
<p> The students must carry valid student ID card of their respective educational institution.</p>
<p>Team members cannot be changed after registration.</p>
<p>No two teams should have a common participant</p>
