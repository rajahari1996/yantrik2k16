<div class="content_box_desc vertical">
  <p>Sixth Sense Technology is a revolutionary way to aggrandize the physical world around us and let's the user to use natural hand gestures to interact with digital information. It involves almost all sections of modern technology. </p>
  <p> The workshop is a secure platform for students to enter into the field of robotics and work on image processing. It helps the students to learn all the basics and apply them in reality. The workshop helps the students to fight all the competitions related to robotics, Image processing, Aerial Robotics etc. </p>
  <p>6th Sense Robotics will focus on getting you up and running with Arduino
    quickly, so that you will understand the basic procedures for working with Arduino and can
    explore further on your own. An Arduino is a small computer that you can program to control
    things like lights or motors along with listening to components like motion detection sensors. It
    can give your project interactivity without needing an expensive and large circuit. Instead, you
    use a computer to program the Arduino, upload your code to the Arduino, and hook up your
    circuit. The duration of this workshop will be two consecutive days with eight hoursâ€™ session
    each day, in a total of sixteen hours properly divided into theory and hand on practical sessions.
    At the end of this workshop a competition will be organized among the participating students,
    Merit will be decided based on the performance in the competition and will be recognised with
    merit certificate.</p>
